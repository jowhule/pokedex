/* move category -> go through all move
 -> store each in either learn method: level-up, machine, tutor
 -> apply filter of region??? but then i need to knmow what all 
 regions available... and keep a store of that, which means
 for region i store each learn method

 !! maybe query for move dmg, element type, special/phys, accuracy, pp

 structure:?
  {regions: {
    level-up: {move: level-learned at}, 
    machine: [move1, move2], 
    tutor: [move1, move2]}
  }
