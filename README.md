## Pokedex

A passion and learning project still in the making because I love pokemon and I think their wikipedia page is too cluttered with unnecessary information.

## TODO

- add page to save pokemon in (team)
- a route to each pokemon to display all stats
- type filter
- make mobile compatible
- do a pokemon guessing game
